<ol type="a">
  <li>

  </li>

  </li>

  </li>
</ol>

​
<b class="color-blue" style="text-transform: uppercase;">Procedure</b>

<ol type="a">
  <li>
      All Protected Disclosures should be addressed to the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Company for investigation.

  </li>
  <li>
      If a Protected Disclosure is received by any executive of the Company other than Chairman of Audit Committee, the same should be forwarded to the Chairman of the Audit Committee for further appropriate action. The executive concerned should take appropriate care to keep the identity of the Whistle Blower confidential.

  </li>
  <li>
      Protected Disclosures should preferably be reported in writing so as to ensure a clear understanding of the issues raised and should either be typed or written in legible handwriting in English or Hindi.

  </li>
  <li>

The Chairman of the Audit Committee shall detach the covering letter and forward only a photocopy of the Protected Disclosure to the Investigators for investigation.

  </li>
</ol>

<b class="color-blue" style="text-transform: uppercase;">Investigation</b>

<ol type="a">
 <li>
    All Protected Disclosures reported under this Policy will be thoroughly investigated by the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Company who will investigate / oversee the investigations under the authorization of the Audit Committee (authority may be obtained without disclosing the identity of the Whistle Blower).

 </li>
 <li>
    The Chairman of the Audit Committee may at his discretion, consider involving any Investigators for the purpose of investigation. But an external Investigator may be employed for investigation only with the approval of the Chairman of the Board.

 </li>
 <li>
    The decision to conduct an investigation taken by the Chairman of the Audit Committee is by itself not an accusation and is to be treated as a neutral fact-finding process. The outcome of the investigation may not support the conclusion of the Whistle Blower that an improper or unethical act was committed.

 </li>
 <li>
    The identity of a Subject and the Whistle Blower will be kept confidential to the extent possible given the legitimate needs of law and the investigation.

 </li>
 <li>
    Subjects will normally be informed of the allegations at the outset of a formal investigation and have opportunities for providing their inputs during the investigation.

 </li>
 <li>
    Subjects shall have a duty to co-operate with the Chairman of the Audit Committee or any of the Investigators during investigation to the extent that such co-operation will not compromise self-incrimination protections available under the applicable laws.

 </li>
 <li>
    Subjects have a right to consult with a person or persons of their choice, other than the Investigators and / or members of the Audit Committee and / or the Whistle Blower. Subjects shall be free at any time to engage counsel at their own cost to represent them in the investigation proceedings. However, if the allegations against the subject are not sustainable, then the Company may see reason to reimburse such costs.

 </li>
 <li>
    Subjects have a responsibility not to interfere with the investigation. Evidence shall not be withheld, destroyed or tampered with, and witnesses shall not be influenced, coached, threatened or intimidated by the Subjects.

 </li>
 <li>
    Unless there are compelling reasons not to do so, Subjects will be given the opportunity to respond to material findings contained in an investigation report. No allegation of wrongdoing against a Subject shall be considered as maintainable unless there is good evidence in support of the allegation.

 </li>
 <li>
    Subjects have a right to be informed of the outcome of the investigation. If allegations are not sustained, the Subject should be consulted as to whether public disclosure of the investigation results would be in the best interest of the Subject and the Company.

 </li>
 <li>
    The investigation shall be completed normally within 45 days of the receipt of the Protected Disclosure.

 </li>
</ol>


<b class="color-blue" style="text-transform: uppercase;">Protection</b>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
      No unfair treatment will be meted out to a Whistle Blower by virtue of his / her having reported a Protected Disclosure under this Policy. The Company, as a policy, condemns any kind of discrimination, harassment, victimization or any other unfair employment practice being adopted against Whistle Blowers. Complete protection will, therefore, be given to Whistle Blowers against any unfair practice like retaliation, threat or intimidation of termination / suspension of service, disciplinary action, transfer, demotion, refusal of promotion, or the like including any direct or indirect use of authority to obstruct the Whistle Blower’s right to continue to perform his duties / functions including making further Protected Disclosure. TheCompany will take steps to minimize difficulties, which the Whistle Blower may experience as a result of making the Protected Disclosure. Thus, if the Whistle Blower is required to give evidence in criminal or disciplinary proceedings, the Company will arrange for the Whistle Blower to receive advice about the procedure, etc.

  </li>
  <li>
      A Whistle Blower may report any violation of the above clause to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, who shall investigate into the same and recommend suitable action to the management.

  </li>
  <li>
      The identity of the Whistle Blower shall be kept confidential to the extent possible and permitted under law.

  </li>
  <li>
      Any other Employee assisting in the said investigation shall also be protected to the same extent as the Whistle Blower.

  </li>
</ol>


<b class="color-blue" style="text-transform: uppercase;">Investigators</b>

<ol type="a">
  <li>
      Investigators are required to conduct a process towards fact-finding and analysis. Investigators shall derive their authority and access rights from the Audit Committee when acting within the course and scope of their investigation.

  </li>
  <li>
      Technical and other resources may be drawn upon as necessary to augment the investigation. All Investigators shall be independent and unbiased both in fact and as perceived. Investigators have a duty of fairness, objectivity, thoroughness, ethical behavior, and observance of legal and professional standards.

  </li>
  <li>
      Investigations will be launched only after a preliminary review by the Chairman of the Audit Committee which establishes that:
      
  </li>
  <ol type="i">
  <li>
      the alleged act constitutes an improper or unethical activity or conduct or violation of the Code; and

  </li>
  <li>
      the allegation is supported by information specific enough to be investigated or in cases where the allegation is not supported by specific information, it is felt that the concerned matter is worthy of management review.

  </li>
  </ol>
</ol>


​

<b class="color-blue" style="text-transform: uppercase;">Decision</b>

<p>
If an investigation leads the Chairman of the Audit Committee to conclude that an improper or unethical act or a violation of the Code has been committed, the Chairman of the Audit Committee shall recommend to the management of the Company to take such disciplinary or corrective action as the Chairman of the Audit Committee may deem fit. It is clarified that any disciplinary or corrective action initiated against the Subject as a result of the findings of an investigation pursuant to this Policy shall adhere to the applicable personnel or staff conduct and disciplinary procedures.
